<h3>Phonetic spelling errors</h3>

<p>There are far too many to list, but Claire’s spell-checker is quite thorough. It performs excellently with phonetic spelling errors  and reasonably well with many kinds of non-formulaic typos, even in Indian given names. Here are some examples: <code>mistek, biszi, shuar, mobail, defentali, sarvising, prajkta, shrddha, rajdenra, cuppal, miatake, leasning</code></p>

<p>It can also spot missing spaces: <code>i willcall neha</code></p>

<h2>Regional variation</h2>

<p>This is done for the sake of standardization. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>UK spelling -> US spelling: <code>colour -&gt; color</code>, <code>globalisation -&gt; globalization</code></li>
<li>UK food words -> US food words: <code>lady finger -&gt; okra</code>, <code>aubergine -&gt; eggplant</code></li>
<li>Hindi food words -> English equivalent: <code>jeera -&gt; cumin</code>, <code>aloo -&gt; potato</code>, <code>brinjal -&gt; eggplant</code></li>
<li>Non-standard spellings: <code>chatni -&gt; chutney</code>, <code>parota -&gt; paratha</code></li>
<li>South Asian regional phrases: <code>email id -&gt; email address</code>, <code>eve teasing -&gt; sexual harassment</code>, <code>kindly -&gt; please</code></li>
</ul>
