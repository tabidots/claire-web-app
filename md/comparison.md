See the data on [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZbXkSMwkUsiQDACrW901wxUNOFH-9dYgAzdIjtrR98/edit?usp=sharing).

### Microsoft Word
- Target audience: **Native speakers**
- Target modality: **Formal writing**
- Approach: ?
- Explanations: **yes**

Too basic and simplistic to be effective.

### Apple Pages + Autocorrect
- Target audience: **Native speakers**
- Target modality: **Formal writing/chat**
- Approach: **pattern matching + dictionary**
- Explanations: **no**

Too basic and simplistic to be effective.

### LanguageTool
- Target audience: **Native and non-native speakers**
- Target modality: **Writing**
- Approach: **pattern matching**
- Explanations: **yes**

A good effort, but it does not analyze the input deeply enough to deliver truly substantial corrections.

### Deep Grammar
- Target audience: **Native speakers**
- Target modality: **Writing**
- Approach: **machine learning/neural networks**
- Explanations: **no**

Slow and not up to the task at all. There are some problems neural networks just aren't made for!

### Grammarly
- Target audience: **Native speakers**
- Target modality: **Formal writing**
- Approach: **pattern matching**
- Explanations: **yes**

Solid for native speakers, with a nice interface, but it is clearly not intended for non-native speakers.

### Ginger
- Target audience: **Non-native speakers**
- Target modality: **Writing**
- Approach: **corpus-based**
- Explanations: **no**

Quite good, but it doesn't offer explanations. The corpus-based approach is a good way to ensure that the corrections are (generally) natural, but it makes it difficult to target specific kinds of errors.

### Claire
- Target audience: **Non-native speakers**
- Target modality: **Chat/conversational English**
- Approach: **pattern matching, phonetic spellcheck, rule-based transformations**
- Explanations: **yes**

Claire's rule-based approach means that specific sentence patterns must be manually accounted for by the sentence analyzer and by the grammar correction programs, but this allows it to target specific linguistic phenomena and give truly useful and helpful feedback.
