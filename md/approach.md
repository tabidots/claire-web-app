# Claire’s approach

Conventional grammar checkers are developed from an ivory-tower approach that is not robust enough for real-world language. Current natural language software is too reliant on statistics to be a trustworthy tutor on its own. Native speakers and teachers are not always immediately accessible. Unhindered by these obstacles, Claire provides English learners with the help they need, when they need it.

## Practical, not prescriptivist
Many of the so-called “traditional” rules of English grammar were actually adapted from Latin grammar hundreds of years ago. Following them [actually produces language that is less natural](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/grammar-myths-prepositions/), because English is not Latin. Claire focuses on the errors that English learners actually make, because it was based on tens of thousands of sentences culled from chat logs, social media posts, and blogs written by non-native speakers.

## Designed for conversational language
Despite the name, most “natural language processing” applications struggle with anything that doesn’t resemble a *New York Times* article. But people certainly don’t talk like newspapers, and software should not expect them to, either. And now that conversations no longer take place exclusively in person, software should also be ready for the short forms, incorrect punctuation and haphazard capitalization that are typical of tweets and texts. Claire handles these with aplomb.

## Accommodates non-native English
Many learner mistakes arise from literal translations of the learner’s first language, which can sometimes elude even the most experienced human teachers. However, Claire is pre-loaded with these insights and can respond robustly and nimbly to unnatural sequences of words.

## Automatic revision
Claire corrects learners’ mistakes on the spot — the most effective moment to do so. From the learner’s perspective, it is more intuitive to simply create a sentence and have it corrected automatically, rather than [asking](https://hinative.com) abstract [questions](http://ell.stackexchange.com) about grammar, [waiting to hear from the crowd](http://lang-8.com), or merely [receiving hints](https://languagetool.org) that something might be wrong. In addition, sentences can contain multiple overlapping errors that are difficult to show without consecutively transforming the text.
