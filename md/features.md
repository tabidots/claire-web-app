# Notable features

Even a linguistic savant would not be able to sit down at a desk and enumerate all the errors that are possible in a language. A true grammar checker for non-native speakers can only be the product of an intimate familiarity with the way non-native speakers actually speak.

Thanks to the tens of thousands of real sentences that helped shape the development process, Claire recognizes many mistakes that are too obscure to be known outside of academia or don’t belong to a formal or well-established category of learner errors.

Listed below are just a few unique features that showcase Claire’s sensitivity to subtleties in the user input. An exhaustive list of everything that Claire is designed to correct is [here](/features.html).

## Chat-speak
While texting and chat have given rise to short forms and acronyms like `u`, `r`, `omg`, and `lol` among native English speakers, it seems that the current wave of messaging apps has utterly transformed the written language of non-native speakers in regions such as South Asia and the Middle East. In some cases, the words have been shortened so much that they barely resemble English and impede understanding. Some learners have **forgotten how to spell basic words** correctly and use these forms even when they write by hand.

* oooooh i get it u knw hw to get ppl tlk to u Englishhh
* im sorry,,,i hv to b d 1 to tel u dis.,,,
* no..once u wer not replyng i thought u may be confused wd wat to write,,dats y askd should i askd anaa..anywys this anser is good..thnk u
* pizza..vegitable..!i cud tell this to doctr..instd of ol othr vegitable he is suggesting to eat..now no chance of thinking abt that...i dnt like pizza..so no point to tell this!!
* nw they would try to do it in life i fear and forcefull crimes may increase due to this i fear, i thnk the stp shd be tkn bck

While issues of language change are always hotly debated, this level of non-standard usage can negatively affect a person’s work and social life — especially among native English speakers, who tend to (wrongly) conflate linguistic fluency and general competence. In addition, computers process text most efficiently and accurately when it is in a standardized format. So, out of necessity, Claire corrects short forms and poor punctuation rather aggressively, and as a side effect, learners can type in a way that feels natural to them while still receiving persistent corrections that ingrain the habit of correct spelling and punctuation.

## Phonetic spelling checker
When asking a computer to understand a sentence, correct spelling is a prerequisite to accuracy. But more often than not, conventional spell-checkers – even Apple’s spell-checker — are merely *typo* checkers, and do not take into account errors like `conviniance`, `cuppal`, `leasning`, `shuar`, `mobail`, `defenetali`, `compiney`. Claire is attuned to the **phonological principles** that cause these kinds of mistakes, which are in fact common to speakers of many non-Germanic languages, and actually tries to **sound out** unfamiliar words as a real human would upon encountering them.

Another important factor to consider in addressing English speakers of various regions is **proper names**. It would be frustrating to have your input autocorrected just because the software was developed from a US-centric perspective. While Claire does not claim to be absolutely perfect in this regard, it does feature a built-in dictionary of common Indian names and a sophisticated Wikipedia/Wiktionary lookup for unfamiliar sequences of words, which allows it to catch things like movie titles and celebrity names that may not be well-known outside their home region.

## Non-native interpretation
Sometimes, learner English is so strongly influenced by the person’s first language that the meaning is not immediately clear to native speakers who have not spent a good deal of time in that linguistic environment. Such insights have been programmed into Claire, giving her the ability to **time-travel** and respond instantly to sentences that might take a human months to understand properly.

Form | Naïve interpretation | Intended meaning
-- | -- | --
`See one film I thought could participate` | Watch one film that I thought could participate | You see, I thought one film could participate
`I didn’t heard good your voice` | I didn‘t hear your good voice. | I didn’t hear your voice (very) well.
`Do you know the film’s another title?` | Do you know that the film is another title? | Do you know another title of the film?
`Byadgi chilli is very less pesticide fed chillies.` | ? | Byadgi chili is a (kind of) chili that is not fed many pesticides.
`This color is everybody liking` | ? | Everybody likes this color.
`sentence structure will be get it in correct form while using big sentence` | ? | We will get the correct sentence structure when we use a big sentence?
`its time to ask why Melamchi could not even after 30 years people ask question` | ? | It’s time to ask why people could not ask questions about Melamchi even after 30 years.
`justin yesterday film niki telling that while merging it will gt poor quality only` | ? | Justin, Niki is saying that yesterday’s film will lose quality when it gets merged.

## Missing words
Grammar checkers almost entirely focus on detecting errors that exist in the text. But only Claire is designed to detect errors of *omission* as well.

### Finite verbs

* I would like to ice-cream after misal  
* becically I like to Indian music  
* how to informal or formal conversation in nice way?  
* i can the most beautiful sunset right now

Many learners of English, especially those from Asian countries, often omit function words and verbs like “be”, “have”, and “there is”, even as main verbs:

* i knw dat in dat lots of mistakes  
* very boring.. don’t know who will the audience of this film
* old songs has some meaning but new songs no meaning at all  
* Also Touch screen is very very irresponsible any solution for it?  
* In our class many girls  
* When no traffic I take 15 minutes. When many traffic I can take 1 hour....

### Missing subjects

* Being a girl, gave the benefit of doubt to Jasleen, like many others! And like many others am embarrassed n let down! Apologies to the guy
* There is one irrigation system but not functioning properly due to budget and irrigation
* Checked in at 2.30 pm, wanted to eat chicken biryani but was not available so ordered parota and chicken masala.
* As the film is more about the philosophical aspects would like to get your opinion regarding this film

### Missing objects

* We couldn’t find
* i will send u later
* hav u recvd?

## Interlanguage pseudopassive
While this term is basically unknown outside of academic literature, this phenomenon is actually quite common among Asian learners of English.

* Ticket also has booked  
* Any special chapati has given to you?
* When this verb can use?
* Only ladies seat not every seat should give in moving vehicle AAP should do this.

It looks like a missing object on the surface, but it is actually the result of two very subtle factors: misapplication of L1 word order and a failure to recognize how word order impacts the doer-receiver semantics of an English sentence. The following illustration shows why a Hindi speaker would produce a sentence like the ones above:

Claire harnesses a sophisticated algorithm and knowledge base to determine if a noun phrase represents an animate object or an inanimate object.

## Derivative morphology
As the product of multiple languages, English has a rich vocabulary, but many learners seem to focus too heavily on nouns. While patterns for word derivation in English are not complicated, most curricula seem to neglect them, causing learners’ vocabulary to stagnate.

* that will not be success  
* And I admission into YonSei University of Medical college.  
* we can not competition so you people know better  
* I need some suggest, How to maintenance our vocabulary  

Claire can spot errors like these and convert a noun to the verb or adjective that the learner intended to use, making their vocabulary more versatile and natural.

## Long-distance concordances

Claire uses an idiosyncratic system to manage what linguists call “long-distance dependencies”. Long-distance dependencies are one of the main reasons that checking grammar and understanding the meaning of text is so difficult. But they are very common in natural language – in fact, the previous sentence contained two of them.

### Noun phrases

### Subject-verb agreement

* Often, our communication is so loaded with judgment and opinions that we do not really listen to what is being said and choose our words unwisely.
* Well, watch this video we found where Arnab debunks all the theories politicians have about the Beef ban and asks them all the right questions.
* I can’t tell you how crazy the people I met thought I was

### Conditionals

### Wh-movement and clause boundaries

NLP software is surprisingly poor at parsing non-linear sentence structures, which are very common at all levels of language. While English is considered a *subject-verb-object* language, there are many exceptions to this. Moreover, detecting missing subjects and objects in the canonical order is tricky enough — detecting missing objects with alternative word orders requires near-surgical precision.

#### Missing object vs. question
* *What sort of technology* would you like to **see** implemented in educational settings? √
* I would like to **see** implemented in educational settings %X%

#### Missing object vs. relative clause
* That is *a chance* we **missed** to win the game √
* We **missed** to win the game %X%

#### Right-dislocated “looks like”
* This is it *looks like* %X%
* This is where he lives *looks like* %X%
* This is *what **it** looks like* √
* This is *what **where he lives** looks like* √

#### Question vs. extra preposition
* You **said about** that %X%
* *What* you **said** about that √
* Why you **said about** that %X%
* *What* did you **say** about that? √
* This is *what* you **said** about that √
