# Why Claire?

Without formal study, children eventually develop the ability to speak their first language or languages without grammatical mistakes. The linguistic community has not yet reached a consensus about why this is so, but it is clear that the fluent production of idiomatic language is a matter of **habit**. Yet, in schools and courses around the world, languages are too often taught as a set of rigid rules, which seems contrary to the brain’s natural learning process.

*Rules are **deliberate**. Habits are **automatic.***

Hindered by rules, some learners never truly develop the habits that will help them become fluent users of a second language. Others fall into bad habits — often *small, easily overlooked, yet significant* mistakes which end up becoming fossilized because traditional curricula do not take them into consideration, or because traditional teaching methods do not correct them persistently enough.

**Claire** is a grammar checker and automated ESL/EFL tutor built for the global community of English learners, which harnesses a unique combination of artificial intelligence and linguistic expertise to help people teach themselves with every sentence they type.
