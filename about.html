<p>Without formal study, children eventually develop the ability to speak their first language or languages without grammatical mistakes. The linguistic community has not yet reached a consensus about why this is so, but it is clear that the fluent production of idiomatic language is a matter of <strong>habit</strong>. Yet, in schools and courses around the world, languages are too often taught as a set of rigid rules, which seems contrary to the brain’s natural learning process.</p>
<p><em>Rules are <strong>deliberate</strong>. Habits are <strong>automatic.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hindered by rules, some learners never truly develop the habits that will help them become fluent users of a second language. Others fall into bad habits — often <em>small, easily overlooked, yet significant</em> mistakes which end up becoming fossilized because traditional curricula do not take them into consideration, or because traditional teaching methods do not correct them persistently enough.</p>
<p><strong>Claire</strong> is a grammar checker and automated ESL/EFL tutor built for the global community of English learners, which harnesses a unique combination of artificial intelligence and linguistic expertise to help people teach themselves with every sentence they type.</p>
</div><div class="info-section" id="approach"><h1 id="claire-s-approach">Claire’s approach</h1>
<p>Conventional grammar checkers are developed from an ivory-tower approach that is not robust enough for real-world language. Current natural language software is too reliant on statistics to be a trustworthy tutor on its own. Native speakers and teachers are not always immediately accessible. Unhindered by these obstacles, Claire provides English learners with the help they need, when they need it.</p>
<h2 id="practical-not-prescriptivist">Practical, not prescriptivist</h2>
<p>Many of the so-called “traditional” rules of English grammar were actually adapted from Latin grammar hundreds of years ago. Following them <a href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2011/11/grammar-myths-prepositions/">actually produces language that is less natural</a>, because English is not Latin. Claire focuses on the errors that English learners actually make, because it was based on tens of thousands of sentences culled from chat logs, social media posts, and blogs written by non-native speakers.</p>
<h2 id="designed-for-conversational-language">Designed for conversational language</h2>
<p>Despite the name, most “natural language processing” applications struggle with anything that doesn’t resemble a <em>New York Times</em> article. But people certainly don’t talk like newspapers, and software should not expect them to, either. And now that conversations no longer take place exclusively in person, software should also be ready for the short forms, incorrect punctuation and haphazard capitalization that are typical of tweets and texts. Claire handles these with aplomb.</p>
<h2 id="accommodates-non-native-english">Accommodates non-native English</h2>
<p>Many learner mistakes arise from literal translations of the learner’s first language, which can sometimes elude even the most experienced human teachers. However, Claire is pre-loaded with these insights and can respond robustly and nimbly to unnatural sequences of words.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-revision">Automatic revision</h2>
<p>Claire corrects learners’ mistakes on the spot — the most effective moment to do so. From the learner’s perspective, it is more intuitive to simply create a sentence and have it corrected automatically, rather than <a href="https://hinative.com">asking</a> abstract <a href="http://ell.stackexchange.com">questions</a> about grammar, <a href="http://lang-8.com">waiting to hear from the crowd</a>, or merely <a href="https://languagetool.org">receiving hints</a> that something might be wrong. In addition, sentences can contain multiple overlapping errors that are difficult to show without consecutively transforming the text.</p>
</div><div class="info-section" id="features"><h1 id="notable-features">Notable features</h1>
<p>Even a linguistic savant would not be able to sit down at a desk and enumerate all the errors that are possible in a language. A true grammar checker for non-native speakers can only be the product of an intimate familiarity with the way non-native speakers actually speak.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tens of thousands of real sentences that helped shape the development process, Claire recognizes many mistakes that are too obscure to be known outside of academia or don’t belong to a formal or well-established category of learner errors.</p>
<p>Listed below are just a few unique features that showcase Claire’s sensitivity to subtleties in the user input. An exhaustive list of everything that Claire is designed to correct is <a href="/features.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="chat-speak">Chat-speak</h2>
<p>While texting and chat have given rise to short forms and acronyms like <code>u</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>omg</code>, and <code>lol</code> among native English speakers, it seems that the current wave of messaging apps has utterly transformed the written language of non-native speakers in regions such as South Asia and the Middle East. In some cases, the words have been shortened so much that they barely resemble English and impede understanding. Some learners have <strong>forgotten how to spell basic words</strong> correctly and use these forms even when they write by hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>oooooh i get it u knw hw to get ppl tlk to u Englishhh</li>
<li>im sorry,,,i hv to b d 1 to tel u dis.,,,</li>
<li>no..once u wer not replyng i thought u may be confused wd wat to write,,dats y askd should i askd anaa..anywys this anser is good..thnk u</li>
<li>pizza..vegitable..!i cud tell this to doctr..instd of ol othr vegitable he is suggesting to eat..now no chance of thinking abt that...i dnt like pizza..so no point to tell this!!</li>
<li>nw they would try to do it in life i fear and forcefull crimes may increase due to this i fear, i thnk the stp shd be tkn bck</li>
</ul>
<p>While issues of language change are always hotly debated, this level of non-standard usage can negatively affect a person’s work and social life — especially among native English speakers, who tend to (wrongly) conflate linguistic fluency and general competence. In addition, computers process text most efficiently and accurately when it is in a standardized format. So, out of necessity, Claire corrects short forms and poor punctuation rather aggressively, and as a side effect, learners can type in a way that feels natural to them while still receiving persistent corrections that ingrain the habit of correct spelling and punctuation.</p>
<h2 id="phonetic-spelling-checker">Phonetic spelling checker</h2>
<p>When asking a computer to understand a sentence, correct spelling is a prerequisite to accuracy. But more often than not, conventional spell-checkers – even Apple’s spell-checker — are merely <em>typo</em> checkers, and do not take into account errors like <code>conviniance</code>, <code>cuppal</code>, <code>leasning</code>, <code>shuar</code>, <code>mobail</code>, <code>defenetali</code>, <code>compiney</code>. Claire is attuned to the <strong>phonological principles</strong> that cause these kinds of mistakes, which are in fact common to speakers of many non-Germanic languages, and actually tries to <strong>sound out</strong> unfamiliar words as a real human would upon encountering them.</p>
<p>Another important factor to consider in addressing English speakers of various regions is <strong>proper names</strong>. It would be frustrating to have your input autocorrected just because the software was developed from a US-centric perspective. While Claire does not claim to be absolutely perfect in this regard, it does feature a built-in dictionary of common Indian names and a sophisticated Wikipedia/Wiktionary lookup for unfamiliar sequences of words, which allows it to catch things like movie titles and celebrity names that may not be well-known outside their home region.</p>
<h2 id="non-native-interpretation">Non-native interpretation</h2>
<p>Sometimes, learner English is so strongly influenced by the person’s first language that the meaning is not immediately clear to native speakers who have not spent a good deal of time in that linguistic environment. Such insights have been programmed into Claire, giving her the ability to <strong>time-travel</strong> and respond instantly to sentences that might take a human months to understand properly.</p>

<h2 id="missing-words">Missing words</h2>
<p>Grammar checkers almost entirely focus on detecting errors that exist in the text. But only Claire is designed to detect errors of <em>omission</em> as well.</p>
<h3 id="finite-verbs">Finite verbs</h3>
<ul>
<li>I would like to ice-cream after misal  </li>
<li>becically I like to Indian music  </li>
<li>how to informal or formal conversation in nice way?  </li>
<li>i can the most beautiful sunset right now</li>
</ul>
<p>Many learners of English, especially those from Asian countries, often omit function words and verbs like “be”, “have”, and “there is”, even as main verbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>i knw dat in dat lots of mistakes  </li>
<li>very boring.. don’t know who will the audience of this film</li>
<li>old songs has some meaning but new songs no meaning at all  </li>
<li>Also Touch screen is very very irresponsible any solution for it?  </li>
<li>In our class many girls  </li>
<li>When no traffic I take 15 minutes. When many traffic I can take 1 hour....</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="missing-subjects">Missing subjects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being a girl, gave the benefit of doubt to Jasleen, like many others! And like many others am embarrassed n let down! Apologies to the guy</li>
<li>There is one irrigation system but not functioning properly due to budget and irrigation</li>
<li>Checked in at 2.30 pm, wanted to eat chicken biryani but was not available so ordered parota and chicken masala.</li>
<li>As the film is more about the philosophical aspects would like to get your opinion regarding this film</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="missing-objects">Missing objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>We couldn’t find</li>
<li>i will send u later</li>
<li>hav u recvd?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interlanguage-pseudopassive">Interlanguage pseudopassive</h2>
<p>While this term is basically unknown outside of academic literature, this phenomenon is actually quite common among Asian learners of English.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ticket also has booked  </li>
<li>Any special chapati has given to you?</li>
<li>When this verb can use?</li>
<li>Only ladies seat not every seat should give in moving vehicle AAP should do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks like a missing object on the surface, but it is actually the result of two very subtle factors: misapplication of L1 word order and a failure to recognize how word order impacts the doer-receiver semantics of an English sentence. The following illustration shows why a Hindi speaker would produce a sentence like the ones above:</p>
<p><img src="images/about/pseudopassive.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Claire harnesses a sophisticated algorithm and knowledge base to determine if a noun phrase represents an animate object or an inanimate object.</p>
<h2 id="derivative-morphology">Derivative morphology</h2>
<p>As the product of multiple languages, English has a rich vocabulary, but many learners seem to focus too heavily on nouns. While patterns for word derivation in English are not complicated, most curricula seem to neglect them, causing learners’ vocabulary to stagnate.</p>
<ul>
<li>that will not be success  </li>
<li>And I admission into YonSei University of Medical college.  </li>
<li>we can not competition so you people know better  </li>
<li>I need some suggest, How to maintenance our vocabulary  </li>
</ul>
<p>Claire can spot errors like these and convert a noun to the verb or adjective that the learner intended to use, making their vocabulary more versatile and natural.</p>
<h2 id="long-distance-concordances">Long-distance concordances</h2>
<p>Claire uses an idiosyncratic system to manage what linguists call “long-distance dependencies”. Long-distance dependencies are one of the main reasons that checking grammar and understanding the meaning of text is so difficult. But they are very common in natural language – in fact, the previous sentence contained two of them.</p>
<h3 id="noun-phrases">Noun phrases</h3>

<li>Well, watch this video we found where Arnab debunks all the theories politicians have about the Beef ban and asks them all the right questions.</li>

<h3 id="wh-movement-and-clause-boundaries">Wh-movement and clause boundaries</h3>
<p>NLP software is surprisingly poor at parsing non-linear sentence structures, which are very common at all levels of language. While English is considered a <em>subject-verb-object</em> language, there are many exceptions to this. Moreover, detecting missing subjects and objects in the canonical order is tricky enough — detecting missing objects with alternative word orders requires near-surgical precision.</p>

<li>Target modality: <strong>Chat/conversational English</strong></li>
<li>Approach: <strong>pattern matching, phonetic spellcheck, rule-based transformations</strong></li>
<li>Explanations: <strong>yes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Claire&#39;s rule-based approach means that specific sentence patterns must be manually accounted for by the sentence analyzer and by the grammar correction programs, but this allows it to target specific linguistic phenomena and give truly useful and helpful feedback.</p>
</div><div class="info-section" id="limitations"><h1 id="limitations">Limitations</h1>
<p>Claire has been tested on a bank of over 32,000 text fragments. These fragments range from three words to three paragraphs, and from nearly incomprehensible to newspaper-level sentences. Claire achieves over 99% accuracy in analyzing and correcting the 32,000 fragments of test data, and roughly 94% on untested data. However, this percentage will vary depending on how closely the input conforms to the kind of data that was used in developing the engine, and the presence of specific linguistic phenomena may also influence Claire’s ability to interpret the text correctly.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-mind-reader">Not a mind-reader</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that words carry less than 10% of a message. The rest is conveyed through body language, facial expressions, and the “music of speech” — that is, the rhythm and intonation of your voice.</p>
<p>When you type a sentence, you might hear a voice in your head reading those words with the same melody and rhythm you use when speaking out loud. However, Claire can’t hear that. She can only hear the words in a machine voice, with a flat tone and an even rhythm, which is very different from how people actually talk.</p>
<p>Human languages – especially English – have many ambiguities that cannot be resolved through words alone. Because of this, Claire may not be able to analyze every sentence the way you intended it. Please keep that in mind as you interact with Claire.</p>
<h2 id="general-ambiguities">General ambiguities</h2>
<p>Ambiguity is inherent in all aspects of language, from spelling (is “read” past or present tense?) to sound (“a new display” vs. “a nudist play”). Humans can use common sense to resolve ambiguity, but computers can’t. And in some cases, humans can’t either, which is what makes jokes and puns possible.</p>
<h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
<p>Informal commands in English consist of the plain form of the verb with no subject: <em>“if you meet this guy don’t forget to punch him.”</em> Unfortunately, missing subjects are a common feature of learner English, and correct sentences can also contain ambiguities if they lack proper punctuation. So, while a significant amount of work has gone into trying to determine whether a verb is a command or lacking a subject, Claire will give better results when commands are clearly distinguished by the word “please”.</p>
<h3 id="conjunctions">Conjunctions</h3>
<p>Because words like “and” can connect a great variety of items, from single words up to complete sentences, it’s not always clear which two things are connected by conjunctions. Some learners make mistakes like <em>“I went and take that”</em>, which creates complications when approaching sentences like <em>“Please read through the corrections I’ve made and practice them when you have the time.”</em> Commas are often optional in such cases, but using them can make parsing easier.</p>
<h3 id="unhyphenated-compound-adjectives">Unhyphenated compound adjectives</h3>
<p>Some common cases have been accounted for, like <em>I am a fun loving person</em>. While this would be a trivial problem if all the input could be assumed to be grammatically correct, that is not the case. Claire can correct phrases with numbers, such as <em>This is a 15 minutes documentary</em>, but other types of unhyphenated compound adjectives will create problems: <em>There is a man eating alligator</em>. The absence of an article before <em>alligator</em> would resolve the ambiguity if the sentence was written by a native speaker, but because non-native speakers typically omit articles, the non-hyphenated interpretation is equally or more likely: <em>There is a man eating an alligator</em>.</p>
<h3 id="direct-address">Direct address</h3>
<p>Using people’s names at the beginning or end of a sentence can produce ambiguity when the name not set off by a comma. In most cases, Claire can add a comma in the correct place if it is missing, but sometimes it may interpret the name as an element of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="fixed-expressions">Fixed expressions</h3>
<p>that do not conform strictly to normal grammar: Some common interjections, like <em>All the best</em>, have been explicitly programmed into the sentence analyzer. However, other set phrases that contain verbs, such as <em>dream come true, easier said than done, long time no see</em> were not considered, as they do not occur frequently in learner English.</p>
<h2 id="word-class-ambiguity">Word class ambiguity</h2>
<p>The most difficult ambiguity to deal with when processing English text in particular is <strong>word class ambiguity</strong>. English words can represent different parts of speech without changing their spelling, and their inflected forms can also belong to more than one word class. For example, take the word “mean” and its four forms:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Form</th>
<th>Possibility 1</th>
<th>Possibility 2</th>
<th>Possibility 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>mean</code></td>
<td>adjective</td>
<td>plain/plural verb</td>
<td>singular noun</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>means</code></td>
<td>singular verb</td>
<td>plural noun</td>
<td>interjection (in Indian English)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>meaning</code></td>
<td>noun</td>
<td>-ing form verb</td>
<td>interjection (in native English)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>meant</code></td>
<td>simple past</td>
<td>past participle</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Proper usage of function words like articles and auxiliary verbs can help to mitigate this ambiguity. However, their absence or incorrect usage presents major problems for syntactic parsing.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Sentence</th>
<th>Looks like</th>
<th>Actual function</th>
<th>Intended form</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>My chat showing pink colour what is meaning</code></td>
<td>present continuous verb</td>
<td>noun</td>
<td>“the meaning”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>What is mean by good enough?</code></td>
<td>adjective</td>
<td>verb</td>
<td>“is meant”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>is dat means dey have sent the DVD?</code></td>
<td>plural noun</td>
<td>verb</td>
<td>“does that mean”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>I am economically independent , but not all the ways. Means I cant wake up without my mother shout</code></td>
<td>plural noun</td>
<td>interjection</td>
<td>“meaning”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Because grammar checking relies so heavily on an accurate analysis of the nouns and verbs in a sentence, this is by far the most significant obstacle to perfect performance. Claire has been tested on over 32,000 text fragments, so many of the common cases have been accounted for, but it is only possible to discover these ambiguities by chance. During the development process, roughly 2.5% of new sentences (25 in 1000) contained unaccounted-for word class ambiguities, which accounted for approximately 10% of bad output from Claire.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-chatbot">Not a chatbot</h2>
<p>Many new and upcoming AI applications are based on a “personal assistant” model that responds to the user’s typed or spoken questions and commands. However, even though Claire is an automated tutor in some respects, it is designed to <strong>evaluate sentences</strong>, not to respond to questions or commands <em>about</em> English.</p>
<p>So rather than asking <em>“What is the difference between because and because of?”</em>, try writing your own sentence to see which one works and which one doesn’t.</p>
<p>There is a very important reason for this: As demonstrated above, it is difficult enough for computers to understand normal, real-life language and to accommodate non-standard usages of words. When words are “mentioned” rather than used, the ambiguity and complexity increase to a level that is far beyond the capabilities of a machine. It is a bit like <strong>asking a calculator how to do addition</strong>. While natural language works well as a user-friendly interface for apps like search or banking, it cannot work if language is precisely the problem that brings the user to the app.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-errors">Semantic errors</h2>
<p>Claire uses certain characteristics of words as heuristics to approximate real-world understanding, which is how it is able to distinguish <em>“The man has eaten”</em> from <em>“This food has eaten”</em>. However, it does not perform semantic analysis or inference. So, Claire will ignore things that are not strictly grammatical mistakes. For example, <em>“He&#39;s at/in the hospital”</em>; <em>“That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t come / haven’t been coming to class”</em>; <em>“She went to his father’s house”</em>.</p>
<p>For a similar reason, Claire is designed to handle only a specific subset of preposition and collocation errors. For example, adjective-noun collocations (“heavy rain” but “strong wind”) were not considered. In these cases, the possibilities are too numerous for a rule-based approach, and it is often too difficult to judge something as completely incorrect or completely correct. Machine learning may be useful in this area, but without the ability to suggest a result with 100% confidence, the learner would be required to judge the appropriateness of multiple — and possibly unfamiliar — choices.</p>
<h2 id="incoherent-input">Incoherent input</h2>
<p>Claire works best when the user marks the boundaries of their sentences properly. Run-on sentences have been accounted for to a limited extent, but, in general, missing punctuation results in ambiguities that can degrade performance.</p>
<p>Also, while Claire may be able to grasp the grammatical structure of sentences much faster than a human, its ability to comprehend text does not surpass that of a human. A baseline level of resemblance to standard English is necessary for optimal performance.</p>
<p>So, it is not reasonable to expect Claire to deliver perfect results on semantically opaque or overall incoherent input, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who wanna weight gain…. Majority cums in loosing one ……</li>
<li>Maam now complete message read ok  </li>
<li>hungry is very less,stomach is sensation of full,  </li>
<li>If I want to inquary about any seek personal ?  </li>
<li>when you are angry you have to pray to god and don’t be angry do good thing like stady good books. or hier a good songs or do arty also</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-structures">Advanced structures</h2>
<p>Many learners struggle with comma usage and forming complete clauses:</p>
<ul>
<li>They thought Rohil also doing the same  </li>
<li>Being a girl, gave the benefit of doubt to to Jasleen, like many others! And like many others am embarrassed n let down! Apologies to the guy</li>
</ul>
<p>Formal writing styles, like essays and books, often contain complex sentences that may be, for example, interrupted – many times, even – by commas and dashes and little asides. Advanced writers, wishing to appear sophisticated, also use participial phrases and clauses frequently. However, Claire was not designed for this level of language and may erroneously edit complex, but correct, sentences.</p>
<p>In addition, there are certain sentence structures that were not considered in developing the sentence analyzer, because they are not a feature of lower- and intermediate-level learner language. These include, among others, such structures as:</p>
<h4 id="negative-inversion">Negative inversion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not only did he...</li>
<li>Never again will I...</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conditional-inversion">Conditional inversion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Had it been better, I might have...</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="info-section" id="faq"><h1 id="common-questions">Common questions</h1>
<h2 id="claire-didn-t-correct-x-mistake-">Claire didn’t correct X mistake.</h2>
<p>The possible types of mistakes that a language learner can make are as infinite as the possibilities of language itself. As far as Claire is concerned, there are three types of mistakes:</p>
<h3 id="one-off-mistakes">One-off mistakes</h3>
<p>Claire identifies mistakes that follow certain patterns. However, many mistakes do not belong to a category of common mistakes. They might even be limited to just one or two people. They might even be accidental, and the same person might not make that mistake again. As a result, these mistakes cannot be generalized in a way that would allow Claire to correct them.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-meaning-mistakes">Semantic (meaning) mistakes</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Claire is not a mind-reader. <code>I am in the hospital</code> and <code>I am at the hospital</code> are both grammatically correct, even though they mean two very different things. Unfortunately, Claire cannot magically jump out of the app and find you in real life to determine whether you are a patient or a visitor.</p>
<h3 id="grammatical-mistakes">Grammatical mistakes</h3>
<p>These are the mistakes that Claire is trained to detect. They include things like: wrong verb forms, wrong plurals, lack of agreement between two things that should agree, missing words, and wrong word order.</p>
<p>Also, please keep in mind that Claire was developed based on real sentences that were written by real people. Often, real mistakes reflect a logic that comes from the person’s first language. Made-up errors will probably not produce good results.</p>
<h2 id="it-says-you-found-a-bug-">It says “You found a bug.”</h2>
<p>Your text led the program down a path where it encountered a mistake in its code. This does <em>not</em> necessarily mean that your sentence was grammatically incorrect.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-revision-1-and-revision-2-">What are “Revision 1” and “Revision 2”?</h2>
<p>Claire uses NLP (natural language processing) tools to help understand the role of each word in a sentence. However, if the text does not look like a newspaper article, the accuracy of these tools decreases significantly. So, Claire’s process involves multiple layers of analysis and corrections that start simple and become more complex.</p>
<p>Corrections that only require simple analysis, such as most spelling mistakes and many fixed expressions, are made before the sentence is split into different parts. This enables more sophisticated text manipulation later on. However, it also means that it is not easy to determine where “early” corrections came from. In addition, if a sentence contains many spelling mistakes, it is too cumbersome to show each one separately.</p>
<p>So, <strong>Revision 1</strong> shows all of the simple edits at a glance. <strong>Revision 2</strong> shows the difference between the original input and the final output.</p>
<h2 id="claire-messed-up-my-sentence-">Claire messed up my sentence.</h2>
<p>The algorithms behind Claire’s sentence analysis need to accommodate a vast range of correct <em>and</em> incorrect sentence patterns. However, since parts of complex correct sentences often look like incorrect sentences, this is trickier than it might seem. To give a simple example, <code>He talking about climate change</code> is wrong, but <code>I read an article talking about climate change</code> is fine.</p>
<p>The sentence analyzer logic has been painstakingly refined over many iterations, and it produces correct results on almost all of the 32,000 sentences that were used as test data. A 95% accuracy rate on new data was observed during development, although the actual accuracy can vary, depending on the level of the text and the amount of ambiguity it contains.</p>
<h2 id="why-isn-t-claire-faster-">Why isn’t Claire faster?</h2>
<p>First, the application itself requires 2 servers: one for the Claire engine (which processes the text you type) and one for <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml">Stanford CoreNLP</a> (which does the initial grammatical parsing).</p>
<p>In addition, CoreNLP and similar natural language processing tools draw on an enormous bank of data in order to process sentences, regardless of their length or complexity. That means that seemingly short and simple sentences might require the same amount of time as long, complex sentences.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-the-labels-so-complicated-">Why are the labels so complicated?</h2>
<p>The grammar checking program needs very specific labels to do its job properly. For example, the word <code>that</code> alone has six different grammatical fuctions. See the <strong>Terminology</strong> section for more information.</p>
</div><div class="info-section" id="terminology"><h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<p>The sentence analyzer uses terminology that may seem quite technical and obscure. While the familiar parts of speech — <em>noun, verb, and adjective</em> – suffice for many conventional teaching scenarios, analyzing a sentence often requires very fine-grained distinctions. This is especially true in English, since many words can belong to different word classes depending on the context.</p>
<p><em>Like</em> and <em>that</em> are two excellent examples of this, and putting them together further compounds the complexity:</p>

<p>Similarly, the error annotations were meant to be helpful, but many of them can be quite technical. In general, there seems to be an inverse relationship between the level of the mistake and the ability to explain it in a simple way. For example, <em>I am go there</em>. However, Claire’s automatic corrections are clear enough to help the learner develop the habit, which is more useful to most people than understanding technical details about a grammar point.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a few cases where a label was originally created for one purpose but was later found to be unnecessary or overlapping with another label. However, by that time, the engine had already become complex enough that it was no longer possible to change the label. So there may be a certain degree of imprecision in the labeling; however, it is also this fuzziness that allows Claire to handle non-native text as well as she does.</p>

<p>The development of Claire represents an attempt to “teach” language to a computer in order to teach language to humans. While these two ways of teaching are obviously very different, the journey has yielded a few significant insights about English and language technology.</p>
<h2 id="why-doesn-t-google-translate-work-">Why doesn’t Google Translate work?</h2>
<p>Despite the apparent magic of tools like Apple’s <strong>Siri</strong> and IBM’s <strong>Watson</strong>, natural language technology is still, even in 2016, chiefly employed in mechanical tasks that do not require deep understanding: fetching data; providing more relevant search results; identifying named entities; recommending restaurants; captioning images; summarizing press releases, medical reports, and academic papers; identifying trends in word usage among various demographic groups for marketing purposes and academic research.</p>
<p>So, while there is software that can “read” a document and tell you that <em>X company</em> is launching <em>Y product</em> on <em>Z date</em>, or that <em>F protein</em> binds to <em>G molecule</em> during <em>H process</em>, that doesn’t mean the software actually understands the process of launching or binding. What you are seeing is the algorithmic dance of word statistics and knowledge databases.</p>
<p>But words and sentences do not materialize from the collision of numbers inside our brains; they emerge out of communicative intent and are governed and transformed by a battery of rules that we are not even conscious of.</p>
<p>Statistical language models correspond to natural language as faithfully as economic models correspond to actual human behavior. Some economists have recognized this and joined forces with neuroscientists and psychologists to create the interdisciplinary field of “behavioral economics”, which seeks to give us a more comprehensive view of how people make decisions. Yet linguists have been more or less banished from the field of natural language technology over the last couple of decades, forced to cede their territory to computer scientists.</p>
<p><em>“Every time I fire a linguist, the performance [of our speech recognition software] goes up”</em> —Fred Jelinek</p>
<p>Whether the use cases have driven the approach or vice-versa, this is not surprising: statistical methods and models are scalable; linguistic expertise is not. Engineers can achieve a surprising amount of translation coverage in a new language without even knowing the first thing about it. But the problem is that if <em>they</em> don’t know anything about the language, does the computer actually end up learning anything about that language? And how accurate can the results actually be?</p>
<p>This is the main reason why, even after the terabytes of data that it has processed, Google Translate remains so (amusingly) disappointing, only able to talk like <em>Homo Linguisticus</em>, not like an actual human. And while Claire does not claim to (or need to) incorporate “semantics” to a significant extent, the accuracy of Claire’s sentence analyzer is a testament to the merits of merging the breadth of statistical parsing with the precision of a rule-based approach, informed by old-fashioned linguistic expertise.</p>
<h2 id="every-word-counts">Every word counts</h2>
<p>Many apps, natural language engines, and English learners focus almost exclusively on <strong>content words</strong>. These are the “heavy hitters” that could almost comprise a news article on their own, in a “Me Tarzan, you Jane” kind of way: <em>senator, schedule, meeting, demand, historical significance, momentum, announce, campaign, victory</em>. They demand the spotlight — and language learners, language teachers, and software developers eagerly give it to them. When people think of enriching their vocabulary, they usually think of adding content words to their mental storehouse of words.</p>
<p><strong>Function words</strong>, on the other hand, are unassuming words like <em>what</em>, <em>of</em>, <em>so</em>, <em>that</em>, and arguably <em>be</em> and its inflections. Software generally ignores them because they are too common and mundane to provide higher-level information like the overall gist, tone, or perspective of an article. Learners often ignore them because their first language marks the content-and-function relationship differently or because the peculiar stress pattern of spoken English makes them <em>sound</em> insignificant.</p>
<p>However, function words have an outsize impact on the meaning and grammaticality of a sentence. To understand the weight of function words, you only need to consider the question <em>“What do you do?”</em>, which does not contain a single content word yet possesses a real-world significance that could hardly be overstated. Or consider the dramatic and non-intuitive difference between sets of phrasal verbs like “take in/out/up/down/on/off/over/away/back”.</p>
<p>So, <em><strong>every word</strong> in an English sentence is important, including the “small” ones.</em> Perhaps <em>especially</em> the small ones.</p>
<p>In spite of this linguistic truth, the NLP community is doubling down on content words, as the multiplication of <a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/11/word-is-worth-a-thousand-vectors/">word vectors</a> is poised to become the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/21/google-a-step-closer-to-developing-machines-with-human-like-intelligence">“next big thing”</a> in the quest to reach a more fine-grained level of comprehension.</p>
<p>This is a very technically dazzling solution to <em>one</em> problem – word sense ambiguity – that is most immediately applicable to two specific use cases: data retrieval and machine translation. In other words, it is the work of engineers, not linguists.</p>
<p>However, outside of machine translation, the distinction between the different senses of polysemous words like “law” or “record” is quite small compared to, say, making an entire statement hypothetical by changing “can” to “could”. And just because people don’t search or shop for thoughts, that doesn’t diminish the difference between “over-thinking” something and “thinking it over”.</p>
<h2 id="functional-formulaic-fluent">Functional, formulaic, fluent</h2>
<p>The data that was used in developing Claire makes another point clear: <em>Not only are function words as important as content words for general understanding, the majority of the obstacles to English <strong>fluency and mastery</strong> lie in the function words.</em> When native speakers perceive someone’s English to be “broken”, they are usually referring to the misuse or absence of function words.</p>
<p>For example, <em>eat</em> is a content word, and in many Asian languages, <em>“Ate”</em> can be a complete sentence, whose meaning might be <em>“Yes, I have eaten”</em> or <em>“Have you eaten?”</em>, depending on the situation. The onus of comprehension is on the listener.</p>
<p>English, on the other hand, is known as a <strong>“low-context language”</strong>, where the speaker must make sure that no blanks are left unfilled: <em>Who</em> ate? <em>When</em> did they eat? In fact, English is stricter than any other language in the world in terms of sentence completeness and word order. This is a unique characteristic of the language that is very helpful for general computational comprehension, because function words are not only semantically important, they are also mandatory in English.</p>
<p>And, for Claire in particular, it is a win-win situation, because the grammaticality of almost every aspect of an English sentence can be assessed <em>before you even need to consider its real-world meaning</em>. The software does not have to concern itself with the meaning of the verb, whether it is “eat” or “prognosticate”, but it is still able to communicate to the learner that their sentence was incomplete and to teach them how to generate the correct form of past-tense sentences and questions with any verb.</p>
<p>This idea works for more than just individual words. In fact, entire sentences can be reduced to sequences of grammatical roles. For example, the subject of an English statement must precede its verb and it must agree with that verb in number, whether it is 2 or 20 words long. Consider the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that <em>a lot of the world <strong>music</strong> that we hear right now in America or in the West</em> <strong>is</strong> not really representative of what people are listening to in West Africa.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of grammar checking, the relationship between “music” and “is” would elude most NLP applications, due to the distance between the words. But the most significant insight, for engineers and English learners alike, is that this sentence is nothing more than a sophisticated version of the pattern <em>I think (that) <strong>THING</strong> is <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Again, this is a win-win situation. By reducing sentences to grammatical formulas like <em>subject-verb-object</em>, it becomes at least somewhat possible to normalize the basically infinite range of possible input. Distance between words is no longer a barrier to constructing patterns and detecting deviations from those patterns. And highlighting the phrases that constitute these sequences gives learners more insight about English sentence construction.</p>
<h2 id="toward-natural-language-processing">Toward “natural” language processing</h2>
<p>Claire’s requirements necessitated some compromises to accommodate a wide variety of native and non-native English, but the developers of the next wave of NLP software, and grammatical parsers in particular, would do well to invite linguists back into the fold. Together, they will be better able to tame the Wild West of conversational language and all the linguistic phenomena that separate real English from <em>See Spot run</em> (or <em>This is a pen</em>, if you prefer).</p>
<p>Until then, voice and chat interfaces will be no more than lipstick on the pig of those clunky touch-tone menus from the 90s (“Press 2 for Spanish”) and translation software output will remain only marginally better than an <a href="https://twitter.com/elbloombito">@ElBloombito tweet</a>.</p>
